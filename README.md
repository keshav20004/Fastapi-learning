# FastAPI Basics 🚀

A beginner-friendly FastAPI project to learn how modern Python backend APIs are built — fast, async, and sane.

This repo covers:
- API creation
- Routing
- Request/response handling
- Data validation
- Automatic docs (the killer feature)

## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a **modern Python web framework** for building APIs using:
- Python type hints
- ASGI (async-first)
- Pydantic for validation

Why people simp for it:
- Blazing fast (Starlette + Uvicorn)
- Minimal boilerplate
- Auto-generated docs (Swagger & ReDoc)
- Hard to shoot your own foot (types save lives)
